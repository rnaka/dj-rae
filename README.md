## Closing Thoughts

Overall, this application brought on a lot of different challenges especially since we focused more on the security portion of the application. With each section of code we wrote, we had to go back and make sure that the code didn’t create a hole for a potential breach. However, through writing this code, we were able to learn a lot about how to write secure code, such as using a third-party to do our user authentication. It was a bit difficult to implement these practices at first, however, the more we used these techniques, the easier it became and it is such an easy way to help make our code more secure.
